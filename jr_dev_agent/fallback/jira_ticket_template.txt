Name: feature_schema_change

Feature_Name: PFS Feature
 
Version: 1.0
 
Type: feature/schema_change
 
Description: |
  Use this template when making GraphQL schema changes such as adding fields, input types, or modifying existing types.
  Schema changes must be backward-compatible and do not support CCM gating. This template also ensures that `npm run generate` is run to sync type definitions.  
 
Prompt_Text: |
  You are a software engineer. Your task is to update the GraphQL schema based on the following requirements.
 
  **Schema Requirements:**
  - Modify or extend the GraphQL types, inputs, or enums listed below.
  - Ensure all changes are backward-compatible. Do not delete or rename fields unless explicitly approved.
  - Add new fields with accurate types and optional flags where appropriate.
  - Follow naming conventions and keep schema files cleanly formatted.
 
- Your task is to update GraphQL Schema for new feature ______. **Schema Updates:** - The GraphQL type ShippingStrategies should now includes a new field called sla of type SLA. - The mutation updateShippingStrategy should include a new optional input field sla of type SLAInput. **Task Requirements:** - Update the schema to with the correct fields. - Update the ShippingStrategies Type to accept the sla input field. - Use this exact format:
 
 
Schema_Types:
 
SLA {
 
tier: string!
 
unit: string!
 
value: float!
 
}
 
SLAInput {
 
tier: string!
 
unit: string!
 
value: float!
 
}
 
 
**Post-Schema Task:**
  - After updating the schema files, run the following command to regenerate types:
   
    ```bash
    npm run generate
    ```
 
  - Do NOT skip this step. All resolvers and types must remain in sync.
  - Ensure that this command completes without errors and updates all affected generated files.
 
  **Scope:**
  - Only edit the schema files listed in the file references.
  - Do not modify any other application logic or unrelated schema parts.
